## The phone call

It's **April 22nd, 2022**, if I'm not mistaken, it was afternoon. I was doing some open source stuff at home living of my passive incomes. Out of nowhere, I
got a call from an unknown phone number. Well, I was busy that time, so delayed it and kept doing it until I got some free time and called that number back.
She took the phone and oh men, I still remember her saying: "I'm calling from Uzinfocom, would you like to get a job at our company?". The thing is, I was
running a whole Linux community by the time and I was actively seeking for someone or a company to leave my community at and later move to other country
without any worry, so her offer got me interested. I responded: "Intersting, alright!" afterwards she said: "Can you come to our office at %#&^%$#@#$"
aaaand... yeah... this call was the the beginning of everything.

## It's job interview, isn't it?

Right after that, I got a message telling me to come to office right after that day. The day passed and I was getting prepared for the interview. Asked for
a location on Telegram and drove my good old Nexia 3 to the location. It took me additional hour to find the place after getting there, cuz I mistook the
turn late and ended up at the other side of company. Called to her and somehow reached to the destination. I was greated there by [Galina], **the best HR woman
I've ever seen**. She led me to HR room and introduced the company, after that, she told me that we will be waiting for the CEO of the company to finish the
session. Got my mac and started doing my own thing without even noticing how 5 hours flew away until he crossed the corridor and called us to his room.
I'm gonna be honest that it was for me the first time when I fathom how CEO himself spoke to people whom they were hiring. Personally, it felt for me as _if
company was trying to be very careful whom they were hiring to the point that even CEO was participating the process_.

> Before Uzinfocom, the highest position person I spoke to on HR screening was either HR person him/her self or team lead whom they were looking developer for.

The dialogue context reached to salary and I got hired at Uzinfocom and I was like: **"That's it?! Technical interview where?! Why it was so DAMN FAST???"**.

## First day

I've been asked to start working as soon as I bring necessary documents. 3 or 4 days passed by and I came to office after getting introduced to a group of
people at room 223. They all were friendly and greeted me warmly. I even mistook tech lead as the head of department, you know... shit happens, he-he :D.
