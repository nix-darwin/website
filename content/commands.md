After successful installation of nix-darwin, there will be a few commands available for you to interact with nix-darwin installation.

# darwin-help

Open configuration options for the current installation of nix-darwin

# darwin-option

`trunk serve` does the same thing as `trunk watch`, but also spawns a web server.

# darwin-rebuild

`trunk clean` cleans up any build artifacts generated from earlier builds.

# darwin-version

`trunk config show` prints out Trunk's current config, before factoring in CLI arguments. Nice for testing & debugging.

# darwin-uninstaller

`trunk tools show` prints out information about tools required by trunk and the project. It shows which tools are expected and which are found.
